# Runner Game

Welcome to the **Runner Game**, a simple yet addictive 2D platformer built using Python and Pygame. The objective of the game is to navigate the player character through obstacles, jumping over them to achieve the highest possible score. This project was a fun way to practice your Python skills and learn about game development using Pygame.

## Technologies Used

- **Scoring**: The score increases as time progresses. The longer you survive, the higher your score.

## Features

- **Animated Obstacles**: Randomly generated snails and flies that move toward the player, with smooth frame-by-frame animations to simulate motion.
